# 🧠 Build a RAG System with Open Tools | CodeWithMe Live Demo

Welcome to our live demo event! This guide will help you follow along as we build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using 100% open source tools. By the end, you’ll have a full pipeline that can answer questions using your own documents — powered by **RunPod**, **Ollama**, **Open-webUI**, and **Gemma3**.

## 🧰 Tools Overview

### 🟩 RunPod
**GPU on demand, cost-optimized**

- Provision GPU compute in minutes  
- Use a container preloaded with Ollama and Open-webUI  
- 🔗 https://runpod.io

### 🟨 Ollama
**Run LLMs locally with ease**

- One-command install and model fetch (`ollama run gemma`)  
- Supports many open-weight models (Gemma, Mistral, LLaMA, etc.)  
- 🔗 https://ollama.com

> 🎯 Helps you pick the right size model for your compute: 2B, 7B, quantized versions, etc.

### 🟦 Open-webUI
**Chat interface + document management**

- Upload your own files for RAG  
- Talk to models via a clean interface  
- 🔗 https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui

2. **Install & run** Gemma with Ollama
3. **Open webUI** to chat with the model
4. **Upload HR documents**
5. **Ask questions** and get grounded responses!
